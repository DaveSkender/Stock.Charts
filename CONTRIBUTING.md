# Contributing to Stock.Indicators

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Before contributing, please be aware that we are accepting these sorts of changes:

- Bug reports and fixes
- Demonstrations of other `Skender.Stock.Indicators` NuGet package features

## Reporting bugs

If you are reporting a bug, please submit an Issue with a detailed description of the problem.  Be sure to include steps to reproduce, code samples, and any reference materials.

## Developing

- Read this first: [contributing to an open-source GitHub project](https://codeburst.io/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-github-contribution-5302260a2940)
- Do not comingle multiple contributions.  Please keep changes small and separate.
- The backlog for this demo project is [here](https://dev.azure.com/skender/Stock.Indicators/_boards/board/t/Stock.Charts).

## Testing

- Since this is just a simple demo project, we basically just want it to pass the build and run without errors.
- Failed builds will result in immediate rejection of your changes.

## Submitting changes

Submit a Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

After a Pull Request is reviewed, accepted, and merged to master, we may batch changes before publishing a new package version to the public NuGet repository.  Please be patient with turnaround time.

## Contact us

Contact us through the NuGet [Contact Owners](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skender.Stock.Indicators) method (preferred) or [submit an Issue](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Charts/issues) with your question if it is publicly relevant.

Thanks,
Dave Skender
