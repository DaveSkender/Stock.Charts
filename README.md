# Stock.Indicators NuGet package Demo

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/skender/Stock.Indicators/_apis/build/status/Stock.Charts)](https://dev.azure.com/skender/Stock.Indicators/_build/latest?definitionId=19)

This is a demo for use of the [Skender.Stock.Indicators](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skender.Stock.Indicators) NuGet package.  It is an Angular 10 website with a .NET Core 3.1 Web Api that auto generates a stock chart.  You can add and remove indicators on the fly, to the chart.  Only a few sample indicators are shown in this demo.  See the [Library documentation](https://daveskender.github.io/Stock.Indicators) for more information and a full list of available indicators.

DEMO: [https://stock-charts.azurewebsites.net](https://stock-charts.azurewebsites.net/) is the Azure hosted live site of this demonstration.  Please note this is hosted on a "cost effective" Azure service plan, so you can attribute slowness to this low-end host.  The package itself is quite fast.

If you want to host yourself on your local computer and review the source code, follow the instructions below.

## Running the demo locally

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12.x or later
- [Visual Studio 2019](http://visualstudio.com) Community edition (Professional and Enterprise editions will work too)

### Steps

1. [Clone the repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

2. Open `\Server\Backend.sln` in Visual Studio

3. Select `WebApi` project and Run by either `CTRL+F5` or `CTRL+SHIFT+W`.  You can also View from right-click menus.  If you've done this successfully, a browser window will open and say "API is functioning nominally."  Leave the browser window open.

4. Open `Git Bash` window and navigate to the `\Client` folder

    ``` bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

    The web application should launch automatically.

## Troubleshooting

If the [Server] Web API does not launch, right-click the Solution and "Restore NuGet Packages"; then, try to Rebuild the entire Solution in Visual Studio.  Make sure the WebApi project is highlighted (bold font), then try `CTRL+F5` again.

If the [Client] website does not launch, check to make sure you have a recent version of Git and Node installed and try the above commands again.  You might also try `npm install -g npm@latest` in the bash window to update NPM to a newer version.
