# Contributing guidelines

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Before contributing, please be aware that we are accepting these sorts of changes:

- Bug reports and fixes
- Demonstrations of other `Skender.Stock.Indicators` NuGet package features

## Reporting bugs

If you are reporting a bug, please submit an Issue with a detailed description of the problem.  Be sure to include steps to reproduce, code samples, and any reference materials.

## Developing

- Read this first: [contributing to an open-source GitHub project](https://codeburst.io/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-github-contribution-5302260a2940)
- Do not comingle multiple contributions.  Please keep changes small and separate.

## Testing

- Since this is just a simple demo project, we basically just want it to pass the build and run without errors.
- Failed builds will block acceptance of your Pull Request when submitting changes.

## Submitting changes

Submit a Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

After a Pull Request is reviewed, accepted, and merged to `main`, we may batch changes before publishing the site.  Please be patient with turnaround time.
